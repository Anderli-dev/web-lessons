        <h1>Про мене</h1>
        <p>My name is Van, I'm an artist, I'm a performance artist. I'm hired to people to fulfill their fantasies,
            their deep dark
            fantasies. I was gonna be a movie star y'know, modeling and acting. After a hundred and two additions and
            small parts I
            decided y'know I had enough, Then I got in to Escort world. The client requests contain a lot of fetishes,
            so I just
            decided to go y'know... full ♂Master♂ and change my entire house into a dungeon... ♂Dungeon♂Master♂ now with
            a full
            dungeon in my house and It's going really well. Fisting is 300 bucks and usually the guy is pretty much hard
            on pop to
            get really relaxed y'know and I have this long latex glove that goes all the way up to my armpit and then I
            put on a
            surgical latex glove up to my wrist and just lube it up and it's a long process y'know to get your whole arm
            up there
            but it's an intense feeling for the other person I think for myself too, you go in places that even though
            it's physical
            with your hand but for some reason it's also more emotional it's more psychological too and we both get you
            know to the
            same place it's really strange at the same time and I find sessions like that really exhausting.
            <br>
            <br>
            I don't know I feel
            kinda naked because I am looking at myself for the first time, well not myself but this aspect of my life
            for the first
            time and it's been harsh... three to five years already? I never thought about it... Kinda sad I feel kinda
            sad right
            now, I don't know why
